# Handwritten Digit Recognition (OCR) using CNN

This project implements an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a large dataset of handwritten digits, and can be used to predict the digits in new images.

# Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. In this project, we utilize a CNN to learn patterns in handwritten digits and make predictions on unseen data. The trained model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset and can also be adapted to recognize digits in custom images.

# Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size and is labeled with the corresponding digit.
